(A work in progress based on project lists, on last modified times of project files, references files, and media files, on YouTube history, and on archived web pages. A whole bunch of designs and unfinished stuff that make up the first 40 years of my life, the next 40 years will go to developing these designs.)

<strong>200403</strong>
  An extension programming language inspired by Lua.
<strong>200410</strong>
  A system programming language inspired by C.
<strong>200512</strong>
  A file system layout inspired by Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

  I enrolled at VAMK in 2004 in the hopes of ultimately working with microprocessors and instruction set architectures, but my studies suffered greatly the first year (2004-2005) due to mental health problems and by the second year (2005-2006) I was no longer in attendance. As such my dreams of working as an engineer in my field of ambition were shattered, but I intuitively started learning and designing systems on my own.
  With my personality (INFP) I had been self-driven since childhood and I quickly found solace in my work, able to bear the depression and anxiety that weighed heavily on my spirit and slowly managed to work up motivation.
  Despite growing up on the x86 architecture and AMD being my processor of choice since K6, I found an interest in older processors such as Z80, 6800, 6502, and ended up falling in love with MIPS and ARM, envisioning them as future desktop architectures.
<strong>200602</strong>
  A 32-bit RISC architecture inspired by MIPS R3000 and ARM7TDMI.
<strong>200602</strong>
  A 16-bit RISC architecture inspired by ARM7TDMI (Thumb) and Z80.
<strong>200602</strong>
  A system for explicit cache management inspired by ARM7TDMI and 6800, allowing for precise control over data flow with separate instructions that guide the processor as to which memory sections are needed. Later expanded by the concept of immediate memory for multiple levels of explicitly managed memory.
<strong>200611</strong>
  A firmware environment for managing and loading system environments (firmware applications and/or operating systems) inspired by BIOS and coreboot.
<strong>200611</strong>
  A hardware hypervisor for virtualisation, management, and monitoring of execution inspired by ARM7TDMI.
<strong>200612</strong>
  A system for volume partitioning and management inspired by MBR.
<strong>200705</strong>
  An 8-bit variable-length RISC architecture inspired by Z80 and 6800.
<strong>200712</strong>
  A system for user-accessible on-die immediate memory inspired by Z8.
<strong>200712</strong>
  A tripartite system of machine-readable object code, being bit code, byte code, and type code, inspired by Lua byte code.
<strong>200803</strong>
  A hardware description language inspired by Verilog.
<strong>200803</strong>
  An 8-bit fixed-length MISC architecture inspired by Z80 and 6800.
<strong>200803</strong>
  A director with directives and directive files for monitoring and management of compilation inspired by C and make.
<strong>200804</strong>
  A data description language inspired by C.
<strong>201111</strong>
  A managed system programming language inspired by Lua and C++.
<strong>201201</strong>
   A functional programming language inspired by Lisp.

<strong>(1996)</strong>
  I began to wonder why our language was different from Swedish in so many ways, why our pronunciation and grammar was different, and why we couldn't study it in school.
<strong>200305</strong>
  I started researching my native Ostrobothnian language after first using it as an inspiration for constructed languages in roleplaying games.

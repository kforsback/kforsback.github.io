<em>No matter how old I get or how much someone hates it, I will never stop with my three domains and related endeavours. It's what drives me and fills me with hope, an irreplacable inspiration and source of motivation. <strong>They are my children that I've taken care of since 2000-2001.</strong> I have filed several police reports and provided plenty of information regarding myself and recent incidents (in Finland and abroad) and will continue to communicate with law enforcement so that I can continue working in peace and quiet.</em>

MPD, NJSP, NYPD, CBZC, PET, SuPo

<em>Be professional. Be heartful.</em>

[ACCOUNTS]

(I need to get a domain to centre everything around, that'll make my life easier and make for less accounts and less mess.)

[NOTES]

A work in progress based on project lists, on last modified times of project files, references files, and media files, on YouTube history, and on archived web pages. A whole bunch of designs and unfinished stuff that make up the first 40 years of my life, the next 40 years will go to developing these designs.

My accounts and my online presence has been an utter mess and I'm slowly sorting it out, hopefully for more inner peace. I've been dealing with a lot and organising my online presence is going to be my zen. A domain is in the works which is going to sort out a whole lot and make my life easier.

Regarding my gaming accounts, I might play like $%@! in some games, but I play for fun and lean toward solo or co-operative; mostly first-person shooters but also a lot of roleplaying.

Pardon my old-school monospaced site while I try to get my life back on track, try to document my many projects and my efforts over the years, and just try to reclaim my serenity and path in life.

I have lived (pretty much) my whole life on welfare, not by choice, and could have had a pretty decent life if it weren't for a few incidents in my life and certain toxic and destructive people (no, I'm not "progressive"). Ever since I was 16 years old and suffered something unfortunate I have waited for and attempted to build for a contentful life where I could actually support myself.

Not end up on Fortune 500, or whatever it's called, but to support myself; preferrably while having fun, which is what my endeavours and my learning has been over the years, creative and trechnological.

Who knows where life will take me.
